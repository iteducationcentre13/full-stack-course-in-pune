          <h2>What Our Students Say</h2>
          <p>One of the prime reasons that shaped my career differently was the Full Stack Course at the IT Education Centre. I was completely new to coding and had very little knowledge of it. But, the trainers did not leave any stone unturned to clarify every single concept with live examples and practical exercises. The project work was so powerful that I felt the interview can be done with full confidence and within a month of completing the course, I got a job in Pune.</p>

          <p>Perfect mix of theory, practical coding, and placement support. One thing that I liked the most was the manner in which the trainers related every module to the real coding/development industry. Resume building was facilitated by their placement team along with mock interviews and I actually got two interview calls in my very first week.</p>
